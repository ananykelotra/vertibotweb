    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p class="text-box">
        High-rise buildings, corporate glass towers, and modern architectural structures rely heavily on exterior glass facades for aesthetics, natural lighting, and energy efficiency. However, the process of cleaning these glass surfaces remains extremely dangerous, expensive, and inefficient. Today, thousands of workers across the world are still suspended on ropes or hanging scaffolding at extreme heights, risking their lives to manually clean windows. This job is not only life-threatening, but also physically exhausting, climate-dependent, and limited by human reach and safety regulations.
Even with safety harnesses and equipment, accidental slips, wind pressure, equipment failure, or fatigue can lead to fatal accidents. Companies spend huge recurring costs on manual labour, insurance, and safety compliance, yet still receive inconsistent cleaning quality. Traditional cleaning methods also consume large amounts of water and chemicals, making the process neither sustainable nor scalable.
In a rapidly advancing world of automation and smart cities, the glass-cleaning industry has seen very little innovation. The problem is clear: we still depend on humans for a task that is repetitive, dangerous, and mechanically suitable for automation. There is an urgent need for a smarter, safer, and fully automated solution that eliminates human risk while increasing efficiency, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.

    <h2>Our Idea</h2>
    <p class="text-box">
        VertiBot is a student-founded robotics startup built by second-year college friends, focused on revolutionizing high-rise glass cleaning using automation and AI. Our solution is a compact, intelligent vertical-climbing robot that attaches to glass surfaces and autonomously moves across building facades to clean efficiently – without risking human life. It replaces rope-based manual cleaning with a fully automated, sensor-equipped robotic system designed to operate safely at any height.
The robot uses advanced suction or magnetic adhesion, water-efficient cleaning mechanisms, and real-time monitoring to ensure complete coverage of windows. With programmable routes, remote control access, and live feedback, VertiBot allows building management teams to schedule cleaning like a service – faster, smarter, and safer than traditional methods.
Our goal is to remove humans from hazardous cleaning work, reduce operational costs for companies, and bring sustainability to building maintenance. VertiBot does not just clean glass — it modernizes infrastructure maintenance, supports smart cities, and protects worker lives.
What began as a classroom idea is now a mission: to replace risky labour with intelligent robotics. VertiBot stands at the intersection of safety, automation, and urban innovation — building a future where no life is put at risk for a window to shine.
